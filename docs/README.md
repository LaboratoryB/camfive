## Controller

The original CAMFive CMA1080K unit comes with a CAMFive-proprietary controller on a green PCB. (Per [here](https://forum.lightburnsoftware.com/t/camfive-laser-and-lightburn-software/10450/4), *newer* CAMFive lasers use Ruida controllers stock, just with non-stock firmware.)

SmartCarve is the only software capable of interacting with this controller, and per [here](https://github.com/LaboratoryB/camfive/issues/11#issuecomment-2357135601), the [$245 "softdog"](https://camfivelaser.com/usb-dongle-key-for-smart-carve-software-smc.html) is required to use SmartCarve with the controller.
